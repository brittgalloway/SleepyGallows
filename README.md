# Sleepy Gallows Portfolio

Sleepy Gallows is a continually evolving portfolio showcasing the creative work of Brittney and Crystal Galloway. Built with Next.js and designed in Figma, it highlights animations, comics, and illustrations. Originally developed with Gatsby, the project was migrated to Next.js for better maintainability and performance. The site is actively maintained, with new features and improvements added regularly.

Sleepy Gallows is not just a static portfolio but a learning-driven project. Every update reflects new skills, optimizations, and experiments with modern web technologies. The migration to Next.js was driven by the need for better routing, layouts, and long-term maintainability. The addition of TypeScript and testing frameworks ensures scalability and reliability as new features are introduced.
