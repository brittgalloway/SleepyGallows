# Sleepy Gallows Portfolio

Sleepy Gallows is a continually evolving portfolio showcasing the creative work of Brittney and Crystal Galloway. Built with Next.js and designed in Figma, it highlights animations, comics, and illustrations.

## Commitment to Learning & Maintenance

Sleepy Gallows is not just a static portfolio but a learning-driven project. Every update reflects new skills, optimizations, and experiments with modern web technologies. The migration to Next.js was driven by the need for better routing, layouts, and long-term maintainability. The addition of TypeScript and testing frameworks ensures scalability and reliability as new features are introduced.
